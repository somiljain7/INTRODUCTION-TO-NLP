spaCy is the leading library for NLP, and it has quickly become one of the most popular Python frameworks. 
spaCy relies on models that are language-specific and come in different sizes. You can load a spaCy model with spacy.load.

preprocessing
lemmatizing (lemma of a word is its base form)
like cool from cooling

stopwords are words that occur frequently in the language and dont contain much information( the, is, ans but not)


token.lemma_ returns lemma 

token.is_stop(true if stopword else false)

Pattern matching 
matching tokens or phrases within chunks of text or whole documents

When you want to match a list of terms, it's easier and more efficient to use PhraseMatcher

In natural language processing, a one-hot vector is a 1 Ã— N matrix (vector) used to distinguish each word in a vocabulary from every other word in the vocabulary. 


Np_utils-
is used to convert array of labeled data(from 0 to nb_classes-1) to one-hot vector.
